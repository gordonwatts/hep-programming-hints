# xAOD Event Data Model Hints

Some hints to help with accessing xAOD objects.

* All momentum, energy, and mass units are in MeV (e.g. `px, py, pz, E, m`). Unless asked otherwise, convert them to GeV by dividing by 1000 as early as possible.

## MissingET

Access:

```python
query = FuncADLQueryPHYS() \
    .Select(lambda e: e.MissingET().First()) \
    .Select(lambda m: {"met": m.met() / 1000.0'})
```

Despite being only a single missing ET for the event, it is stored as a sequence. Thus you must get the first object and then access the `.met()` method from there.

## xAOD Tool Access

Lots of things have to be accessed by creating tools. The code below should be used directly to help
define tools in the code. This code must be copied into the code you are writing.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import Callable, Iterable, List, Optional
from func_adl import ObjectStream
from func_adl import func_adl_callable

T = TypeVar("T")


@dataclass
class ToolInfo:
    name: str


def make_a_tool(
    query: ObjectStream[T],
    tool_name: str,
    tool_type: str,
    include_files: Optional[List[str]],
    init_lines: List[str] = [],
) -> Tuple[ObjectStream[T], ToolInfo]:
    """
    Injects C++ code into the query to initialize a tool of the specified type.

    This function sets up the necessary C++ code to create and initialize a tool (such as
    BTaggingSelectionTool) in the analysis workflow. The tool will be available in the C++
    code under the variable name specified by `tool_name`, which can be referenced in
    initialization lines and later code.

    Args:
        query: The ObjectStream to attach the tool initialization metadata to.
        tool_name: The variable name to use for the tool instance in the C++ code.
        tool_type: The C++ class name of the tool to instantiate.
        include_files: List of C++ header files to include for the tool.
        init_lines: List of C++ code lines to run for tool initialization. You can use
            `{tool_name}` in these lines to refer to the tool variable. You should
            include the call to `ANA_CHECK({tool_name}->initialize());`.

    Returns:
        A tuple containing:
            - The updated ObjectStream with the tool initialization metadata.
            - A ToolInfo object containing the tool's name. Pass this to `make_tool_accessor`

### BTaggingSelectionTool: getting jet b-tagging results

Use this tool to get either a tag weight/discriminant for b-or-charm tagging and to see if a jet is "tagged" for a particular working point. These are provided by the FTAG group in ATLAS.

Operating Point Info:

* `FixedCutBEff_65`, `FixedCutBEff_70`, `FixedCutBEff_77`, `FixedCutBEff_85`, `FixedCutBEff_90`
* [Further information for user](https://ftag.docs.cern.ch/recommendations/algs/r22-preliminary/#gn2v01-b-tagging)
* By default choose the `FixedCutBEff_77` working point.
* Make sure to let the user know if you choose an operating point in your text explanation.

Make sure the `tool_name` is different if you need to define multiple tools (because user needs more than one operating point)! Name them something reasonable so the code makes sense!

Make sure to copy in the code block in the section above `xAOD Tool Access`.

```python
# Specific for the below code
from func_adl_servicex_xaodr25.xAOD.jet_v1 import Jet_v1

# Define the tool

    init_lines=[
        'ANA_CHECK(asg::setProperty({tool_name}, "OperatingPoint", "FixedCutBEff_77"));',
        "ANA_CHECK({tool_name}->initialize());",
    ],
)

# If you need the tag weight. Tag weights, output of a GNN, are between -10 and 15.

    tag_tool_info,
    function_name="tag_weight",
    # false in next line for b-tagging weight, true for c-tagging weight
    source_code=["ANA_CHECK({tool_name}->getTaggerWeight(*jet, result, false));"],
    arguments=[("jet", Jet_v1)],
    return_type_cpp="double",
    return_type_python="float",
)

# If you need to know if a jet is tagged or not.
jet_is_tagged = make_tool_accessor(
    tag_tool_info,
    function_name="jet_is_tagged",
    source_code=[
